Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep up to date with their changes.

For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

After you have done that, in your terminal:

Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated)
Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin
